# OSINT Reconnaissance Processor Requirements
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

changedetection.io>=0.53.1
dnspython>=2.0.0
python-whois>=0.8.0
sslyze>=6.0.0
requests>=2.26.0
mac-vendor-lookup>=0.1.12

# IMPORTANT: Cryptography version constraint
# sslyze requires cryptography<45, but changedetection.io 0.52.4 ships with cryptography==46.0.3
# This will downgrade cryptography to 44.x which is compatible with both packages.
# If you experience any issues, this is likely the cause.
